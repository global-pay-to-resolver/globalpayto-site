| Requirement | Status |
| --- | --- |
| README quality | Pass - README documents GlobalPayTo hosted actions, signed-in history, Cubid auth config, and starter package boundaries. |
| License | Missing - no license chosen for this public repo. |
| AGENTS guidance | Pass - repo role, upstream fork note, package path caveat, and session-log expectations are documented. |
| Session log | Pass - canonical `agent-context/session-log/` folder and guidance exist. |
| Future ideas | Pass - deferred ideas file exists and is explicitly not an active roadmap. |
| Docs placement | Pass - GlobalPayTo engineering docs live under `docs/engineering/`; blog planning lives under `docs/blog-posts/`. |
| Cubid architecture | Pass - docs describe Login with Cubid, signed-in route selection, signed-in history, and browser/server config boundaries. |
| Testing strategy | Partial - lint, typecheck, build, browser secret scan, and route-selection privacy scan exist; no formal test coverage governance yet. |
| Local acceptance harness | Partial - local browser smoke checks are used during implementation; no committed e2e test suite yet. |
