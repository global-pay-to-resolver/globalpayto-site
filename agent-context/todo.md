Status: Complete  
Feature branch: main  
Session log: agent-context/session-log/main.md  
Depends on: mypaytag-sdk:GPTS-S1-T1, mypaytag-sdk:GPTS-S1-T2, mypaytag-sdk:GPTS-S1-T3, mypaytag-sdk:GPTS-S1-T7

Define the browser-facing contract for hosted route-selection actions.

Acceptance notes:

- Page inputs use opaque action identifiers or short-lived action tokens.
- Page outputs cover user denied, selected route/default, expired action, invalid action, and restart-required states.
- Notification-triggered visits from Cubid comms use the same safe action identifier model.
- Contract does not require direct production Supabase access from the public site.

### GPTW-S1-T2 Define Browser-Safe Runtime Configuration

Status: Complete  
Feature branch: main  
Session log: agent-context/session-log/main.md  
Depends on: TBD

Define which environment variables and runtime settings are browser-safe for the public site.

Acceptance notes:

- Browser-safe values use `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`.
- Resolver secrets, Cubid dapp API keys, service-role keys, provider callback credentials, and database credentials stay out of browser env vars and client bundles.
- README setup guidance reflects the MyPayTag hosted-action role rather than only the Cubid starter baseline.

Status: Todo
Feature branch: codex/mypaytag-mvp-realignment-20260628
Gap note: agent-context/2026-06-28-mypaytag-site-mvp-gap-review.md
Depends on: mypaytag:GPTR-S7-T4, mypaytag-site:GPTW-S7-T4

Prevent static route-selection fixtures from masking staging and production failures.

Acceptance notes:

- Static hosted-action fallback is available only when an explicit local development mock mode is enabled.
- Staging and production fail closed when resolver backend action hydration or completion calls fail.
- Mock mode is visible in local UI and logs so it cannot be confused with hosted staging smoke.
- Existing negative-disclosure behavior for invalid, expired, completed, denied, and already-used action states is preserved.
- Browser-secret and route-selection privacy checks still pass after fallback changes.

### GPTW-S8-T5 Update Launch Smoke For SmarTrust And NEAR 1Click

Status: Todo
Feature branch: codex/mypaytag-mvp-realignment-20260628
Gap note: agent-context/2026-06-28-mypaytag-site-mvp-gap-review.md
Depends on: mypaytag-site:GPTW-S8-T2, mypaytag-site:GPTW-S8-T4, smartrust-wallet:SMTW-S1-T2

Revise launch-readiness guidance for the updated MVP.

Acceptance notes:

- Smoke checklist requires local lint, typecheck, build, browser secret scan, OpenAPI sync, route-selection privacy scan, and updated execution-content checks before hosted smoke.
- Hosted smoke covers Cubid identity/consent, MyPayTag paytag validation, route registration, resolve, provider callback, hosted action completion, and negative-disclosure states.
- Hosted smoke includes SmarTrust acting as the first PayingDapp and PayToDapp.
- Hosted smoke includes a NEAR 1Click swap or bridge quote, selected quote, and payable instruction path.
- Checklist clarifies that same-chain same-token transfer handling is a PayingDapp decision, not something MyPayTag should force.

### GPTW-S8-T6 Replace Broad Solver Content Guardrails

Status: Todo
Feature branch: codex/mypaytag-mvp-realignment-20260628
Gap note: agent-context/2026-06-28-mypaytag-site-mvp-gap-review.md
Depends on: mypaytag-site:GPTW-S8-T1

Update site validation scripts so they enforce the revised phase split.

Acceptance notes:

- `pnpm check:solver-content` no longer requires all six solver names to appear as equivalent homepage content.
- The check requires NEAR Intents / 1Click to appear as Phase 1/MVP execution-adapter content.
- The check requires LI.FI, Squid, 0x, Across, LayerZero / Stargate, broad fanout, and generic adapters to be labeled Phase 2 or future when they appear.
- The check fails if public content says NEAR 1Click is future-only or non-MVP.
- Existing private-boundary checks for service-role language, provider credentials, private resolver env names, and private repo links remain enforced.
