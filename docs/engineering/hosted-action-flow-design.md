# Hosted Action Flow Design

Date: 2026-06-24  
Status: Sprint 2 design  
Repo: `globalpayto-site`

## Setup And Authorization Flow

The public site no longer hosts per-request setup or authorization approval pages.
Send-to is modeled as pre-authorized incoming payment channels: requesting apps
are enabled by default, while users retain control over which receive route or
PayToDapp should be preferred for a supported path.

Deleted route family:

- `/actions/setup/[actionId]`

The resolver must not emit setup or authorization action URLs for ordinary
requesting-app access. Status-only outcomes such as `no_route` and
`authorization_required` may still exist for API handling, revocation, invalid
state, or future management flows, but they do not route to this site for
per-request approval.

## Route Selection Flow

Route family: `/actions/route-selection/[actionId]`

Purpose:

- let an authenticated user choose a default PayToDapp for a single route preference tuple,
- show only route options for the current action,
- keep the current default and eligible PayToDapps unavailable until action validation succeeds.

The page is protected by Sign in with Cubid. The action id is present in the URL,
but route details are fetched from the action API only after the browser reaches
the signed-in state.

Preference tuple:

- user,
- pay-to alias,
- chain,
- network,
- asset,
- PayingDapp,
- selected PayToDapp.

Visible states:

- `ready`: show masked identifier, PayingDapp, route, eligible PayToDapps, and current default,
- `selected_route`: confirm the selected default,
- `denied`: confirm the user made no change,
- `expired`: show restart-safe copy,
- `invalid`: show restart-safe copy,
- `completed`: show already-completed copy,
- `restart_required`: show generic restart/setup-needed copy.

Interaction behavior:

- the first eligible option is never auto-submitted by the site,
- the current default is visually selected when the action loads,
- the user must explicitly choose an option and submit,
- submitting stores only local Sprint 2 UI state and shows `selected_route`,
- declining stores only local Sprint 2 UI state and shows `denied`,
- expired, invalid, completed, and restart-required states disable route controls.

Production transition criteria:

- save and leave-unchanged states are shown only after backend confirmation,
- the backend must complete or invalidate the action token before the site renders success,
- the backend must create the required audit event before the site renders success,
- expired, replayed, or unauthorized submissions render safe restart-required or expired states without private diagnostics.

Displayed route details:

- route label may show chain, network, and asset,
- PayToDapp names may be shown only for eligible options in this action,
- no unrelated routes, unrelated PayToDapps, wallet addresses, route counts, private diagnostics, or provider internals are shown.

## Incoming History Flow

Route family: `/history`

Purpose:

- let a signed-in user review incoming GlobalPayTo resolver activity,
- group activity by PayingDapp, PayToDapp, token, or chain,
- quick-filter by queries, intents, transactions, or all activity.

Activity types:

- queries: a PayingDapp checked available routes only,
- intents: a request such as "send USDT from Base to this recipient" produced a set of options,
- transactions: an option was selected and a transfer was initiated.

The All filter clears the activity-type filter and shows the same result as if
all activity types were selected. History rows must not expose wallet addresses,
unrelated routes, provider internals, or settlement claims.

## Mock Data Boundary

Local development uses mock action state when a resolver backend URL is not
configured. Mock state must preserve the privacy contract:

- action IDs are opaque,
- hydrated details are fixture-only,
- expired and invalid states do not reveal recipient existence,
- no production Supabase access or resolver secrets are introduced.

Before real action links are distributed, hosted action routes must set
`noindex`/`noarchive` robot behavior and a strict referrer policy so opaque
action URLs are not indexed or leaked through outbound navigation.
